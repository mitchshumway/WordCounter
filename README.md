# Word Counting Challenge

## Description and Roadmap

The goal of this challenge was simply to determine the words that most frequently appeared in a given string made up of multiple words. I challenged myself to push it a little further so that it was able to determine the most frequently used words in any given string that a user wanted to use. I also wanted the results to be displayed on the webpage and not just in the console. This required me to use knowledge from previous weeks about HTML and DOM as well as to rewrite portions of the starter code in order to achieve. I then realized that for almost any string, the most frequently used words were always going to be things like "and" and "the" which didn't seem too interesting to me, so I went in and removed these words to make the results more valuable. I would like to make the web page look cleaner with some CSS. There are also a handful of contractions that I would like removed, but I cannot figure out how contractions work in JavaScript so I will return for this at another time.
